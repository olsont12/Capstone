Executive Summary
Monarch Butterflies have been in a decline.  I personally see far fewer of them each year.  I am going to analyze the data of their migrations and then the effect of changes in migration date and milkweed growth.  I am hoping to see how recent publicity for helping Monarchs is impacting their population.  

I personally plant a variety of milkweed, the host plant for Monarchs, in my own yard.  I also have raised some caterpillars over the last two years.  
Over the last few years, my family has become educated in the life cycle of different species of butterflies, gardening for butterflies and environmental factors of different butterfly species and other pollinators.  Because of this, we have planted nectar plants to attract different species of butterflies and host plants to encourage them to reproduce.  We have been fortunate to observe the life cycle of three different species.  It has allowed me to connect with another of my interests â€“ photography.  I am concerned about the population of the Monarchs.  


Data Questions 
Are there any changes in dates of migrations (spring and fall) for various locations?
What effect did weather play?
Population year to year?
Changes in Milkweed Growth?
